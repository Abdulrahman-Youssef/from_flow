# form_flow

FormFlow replaces messy Excel data entry with a simple, intuitive app form. It guides users with predefined options, input validation, and smart controls to prevent spelling mistakes, extra spaces, and formatting errors. The result is perfect data, right from the source.

## Getting Started
Project Title: FormFlow - Standardized Data Entry Application

The Problem:
Manually entering data into Excel sheets is the leading cause of "dirty data." Inconsistent spellings, unwanted spaces, and incorrect formats create a massive cleanup burden for analysts, leading to delays and inaccurate insights.

Our Solution:
FormFlow is a Flutter-based mobile application that replaces unstructured Excel entry with a controlled and guided data input experience. We enforce data quality at the point of entry, ensuring information is consistently formatted and valid from the moment it's collected.

Key Features:

Structured Forms: Replace open-ended Excel cells with dedicated form fields (text, dates, dropdowns).

Input Validation: Prevent errors in real-time (e.g., ensuring email fields contain "@", numbers are within a valid range).

Predefined Options: Use dropdown menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes to eliminate spelling variations (e.g., selecting "New York" instead of typing "NY", "ny", "new york").

Auto-Formatting: Automatically trim whitespace and standardize text casing as the user types.

Export Ready: Collected data is automatically compiled into a clean, well-structured file (CSV/JSON) that is immediately ready for analysis.
